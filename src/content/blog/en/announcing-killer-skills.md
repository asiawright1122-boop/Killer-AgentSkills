# Welcome to the Future of AI Development

Today, we are excited to announce the public launch of **Killer Skills**, a platform designed to bridge the gap between human creativity and AI execution.

## Why Killer Skills?

As AI coding agents like **Windsurf**, **Cursor**, and **Claude Code** become more powerful, they need more than just raw intelligence—they need **skills**. They need specialized tools to access databases, interact with APIs, and manage complex workflows.

Killer Skills provides a standardized, verified directory of these tools, packaged as **MCP Servers** (Model Context Protocol).

## Key Features

- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with all major AI coding environments.
- **One-Command Install**: `npx killer-skills add <skill>` is all you need.
- **Verified Quality**: Every skill is vetted for security and performance.

## What's Next?

We are just getting started. In the coming weeks, we will be rolling out:
- **Community Submissions**: Submit your own skills.
- **Skill Analytics**: See how popular your skills are.
- **Premium Skills**: Advanced tools for enterprise use cases.

Stay tuned!
