# Welcome to Killer-Skills: Superpowers for Your AI Agent

Today, we are thrilled to announce the launch of **Killer-Skills** — the first open marketplace and registry for AI agent capabilities.

## The Problem with Today's AI Agents

AI agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) are revolutionary, but their potential is often limited by the tools they can access. Until now, developers frequently had to build their own MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers from scratch for specific tasks like PDF editing, Excel automation, or managing GitHub repositories.

Killer-Skills changes that.

## What is Killer-Skills?

Killer-Skills is a centralized registry of verified, professional-grade skills that your AI agent can instantly discover, install, and use.

### Key Features

-   **Universal Registry**: Over 1,000 verified skills available with a single command.
-   **Deep MCP Integration**: Built on Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol for seamless agent interaction.
-   **Multi-IDE Support**: Works with your favorite tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Amp, and Goose.
-   **Security First**: Every skill is isolated and validated for safe execution.

## Start Right Now

Leveling up your agent is simple. Just run the following in your terminal:

```bash
# Install the CLI
npm install -g killer-skills

# Search for a skill
killer search google-maps

# Add a skill to your agent
killer add google-maps
```

## The Future is Autonomous

We believe in a future where agents can "learn" (install) new capabilities on the fly as they perform tasks. Killer-Skills provides the necessary infrastructure, turning AI tools into a vast ecosystem of connected intelligence.

## Join the Revolution

Killer-Skills is a community-driven project. Explore the documentation, check out the [Marketplace](https://killer-skills.com/en/blog), and start contributing by creating your own skills.

Let's build the future of agents together.
