# Instant Professionalism: How Theme-Factory Elevates Your AI Output

When an AI agent generates a slide deck or a landing page, the content might be brilliant, but the "look and feel" often lacks cohesion. Branding isn't just a secondary layer; it's the visual language that establishes trust and authority.

The official **theme-factory** skill from Anthropic solving this problem by providing a curated library of professional design systems. Whether you are building a corporate report or a creative portfolio, this skill allows your AI agent to apply consistent, high-end styling in seconds.

```bash
# Equip your agent with theme-factory
npx killer-skills add anthropics/skills/theme-factory
```

## What is the Theme-Factory Skill?

`theme-factory` is a styling engine designed specifically for AI-generated artifacts. It works by decoupling content from presentation, allowing agents to swap "skins" without affecting the underlying data.

### 1. Curated Professional Themes
The skill comes with 10 pre-set themes, each including:
- **Cohesive Color Palettes**: Hand-picked hex codes for primary, secondary, and accent colors.
- **Complementary Font Pairings**: Professionally matched header and body fonts.
- **Visual Identity**: A distinct mood tailored for specific audiences.

### 2. On-the-Fly Theme Generation
If the pre-set themes don't fit, the skill can generate a brand-new theme from scratch based on simple descriptions like "Cyberpunk Finance" or "Eco-Friendly Wellness."

## Exploring the Starter Themes

Here are some of the high-end themes available out of the box:

- **Ocean Depths**: Professional, calming, and maritime—perfect for corporate finance.
- **Modern Minimalist**: A clean, contemporary grayscale aesthetic for tech startups.
- **Midnight Galaxy**: Dramatic and cosmic deep tones for high-impact presentations.
- **Forest Canopy**: Natural and grounded earth tones for sustainability or wellness projects.
- **Tech Innovation**: Bold and modern tech aesthetic for developers and engineers.

## Why Branding Matters for AI Agents

For developers and product managers using AI agents to build tools like [Web Artifacts](https://killer-skills.com/en/blog/mastering-generative-art-with-claudecode-skills), consistency is the biggest challenge. Without a theme system, every new component might have a different color blue or a slightly different font weight.

`theme-factory` ensures that:
- **Consistency**: Your entire project looks like it was designed by a single person.
- **Speed**: You don't have to manually write CSS variables for every new page.
- **Quality**: You leverage design principles built into the skill's foundations.

## How to use Theme-Factory with Killer-Skills

1.  **Install**: Use the CLI to add the skill to your project.
2.  **Showcase**: Ask your agent to "show the theme showcase" to see all 10 visual styles.
3.  **Apply**: Command the agent to "Apply the 'Ocean Depths' theme to my current report."
4.  **Customize**: If needed, ask for a "warm and vibrant version of the 'Sunset Boulevard' theme."

## Conclusion

The `theme-factory` skill transforms your AI agent from a simple coder into a brand-conscious designer. By ensuring every artifact is beautiful and consistent, it raises the bar for what AI-generated content can achieve.
