# Beyond the Bullet Point: Creating Elite Presentations with the PPTX Skill

In the business world, a presentation is more than just information—it's a performance. Most AI-generated slides suffer from what we call "The Template Trap": boring bullet points on a white background. To truly win an audience, you need high-end design, intentional color palettes, and balanced layouts.

The official **pptx** skill from Anthropic empowers your AI agent (like Claude Code) to become a senior presentation designer. It doesn't just "fill in" slides; it architect's them using professional design systems and modern web technologies like **PptxGenJS**.

```bash
# Equip your agent with the pptx skill
npx killer-skills add anthropics/skills/pptx
```

## What is the PPTX Skill?

The `pptx` skill is a design-first framework for slide creation and manipulation. It's built on three pillars:
- **PptxGenJS**: A powerful JavaScript engine for building slides from scratch.
- **Markitdown**: For deep structural reading and text extraction from existing decks.
- **Design Intelligence**: Built-in knowledge of color theory, typography, and professional layouts.

## High-End Design Principles

The `pptx` skill enforces a "No Boring Slides" policy through several core principles:

### 1. The "Dominance over Equality" Rule
Professional designers never give all colors equal weight. The skill uses a 60-30-10 rule: 60% dominant color (e.g., Midnight Executive Navy), 30% supporting tones (Ice Blue), and 10% sharp accent (White).

### 2. The Visual Motif
Instead of random decorations, the skill picks ONE distinct visual motif—like rounded image frames or thick single-sided borders—and carries it consistently across every slide. This creates a cohesive "brand" feeling for your presentation.

### 3. Typography with Personality
The skill moves beyond Arial. It pairs bold headers (like Impact or Georgia) with clean, readable body fonts (like Calibri or Garamond) to establish a clear information hierarchy.

## Advanced Capabilities

### Slide Surgery & Editing
Unlike simple PDF converters, the `pptx` skill can "unpack" a presentation into its raw XML components. This allows the agent to:
- **Swap Layouts**: Change a 2-column layout to a 3-column grid while preserving content.
- **Update Master Slides**: Apply a new brand color or logo across 100 slides instantly.
- **Add Speaker Notes**: Programmatically generate notes for the presenter based on slide content.

### Data Visualization
The skill can take raw data from the [xlsx skill](https://killer-skills.com/en/blog/mastering-excel-automation-with-xlsx-skills) and transform it into large "Stat Callouts"—big, bold numbers that capture attention instantly—rather than cluttered, unreadable charts.

## Practical Use Cases

### Automated Investor Pitch Decks
Generate a 10-slide pitch deck where the design adapts to the industry (e.g., "Coral Energy" for startups, "Midnight Executive" for finance).

### Global Brand Updates
Take an existing company deck and "reskin" it with the latest brand guidelines in minutes.

### Content Summarization
Feed a 50-page PDF into the [pdf skill](https://killer-skills.com/en/blog/mastering-pdf-automation-with-ai-skills) and have the `pptx` skill automatically generate a 5-slide executive summary.

## Conclusion

The `pptx` skill is about more than just file formats—it's about **visual authority**. It ensures that when your AI agent builds a presentation, it looks like it was designed by a human expert.
