# Speak Like a Leader: Mastering the Internal-Comms Skill

In an era of remote work and rapid scaling, communication is the glue that holds an organization together. But high-quality communication is hard—it requires the right tone, the right format, and the right level of detail. Writing a weekly update that actually gets read is a skill in itself.

The official **internal-comms** skill from Anthropic equips your AI agent with the templates and tonal guidelines used by elite organizations. It moves beyond generic "corporate speak" to provide structured, actionable, and professional internal messaging.

```bash
# Equip your agent with the internal-comms skill
npx killer-skills add anthropics/skills/internal-comms
```

## What is the Internal-Comms Skill?

The `internal-comms` skill is a resource-intensive repository of enterprise-grade communication formats. It ensures that when your agent writes an update, it follows the specific structures that leadership teams expect.

### 1. The Power of 3P Updates
One of the core features of this skill is the **3P Format**:
- **P**rogress: What was actually accomplished?
- **P**lans: What is the roadmap for the next period?
- **P**roblems: What are the blockers or risks that need attention?

This structure is the gold standard for executive updates because it is concise, honest, and forward-looking.

### 2. Comprehensive Comm Types
The skill isn't just for status reports; it handles the full spectrum of internal needs:
- **Company Newsletters**: Professional and engaging wide-scale updates.
- **Incident Reports**: Objective and structured post-mortems for technical or business issues.
- **FAQ Responses**: Clear, authoritative answers to common team questions.
- **Leadership Updates**: High-level summaries for SVPs and C-suite executives.

## How the Skill Works

When you ask an agent to "Write a project update," the `internal-comms` skill triggers a multi-step workflow:
1.  **Type Identification**: It determines if you need a status report, a newsletter, or an FAQ.
2.  **Guideline Loading**: It loads the specific "Example" file (e.g., `3p-updates.md`) to understand the required tone and formatting.
3.  **Content Gathering**: It uses its context to pull the most relevant progress and risks into the template.

## Practical Use Cases

### Automated Status Reporting
Connect your agent to your codebase or task tracker. Have it use the `internal-comms` skill to generate a perfectly formatted **3P update** every Friday at 5 PM.

### Incident Management
During a system outage, have your agent draft the initial **Incident Report** based on terminal logs and deployment history, ensuring the tone is objective and professional.

### Culture Building
Draft monthly "All-Hands" newsletters that highlight team wins, new hires, and upcoming milestones with a consistent, encouraging brand voice.

## How to use it with Killer-Skills

1.  **Install**: `npx killer-skills add anthropics/skills/internal-comms`
2.  **Command**: "Write a 3P update for the 'Deep_Search' project based on our progress this week. Highlight the memory leak as a Problem."
3.  **Refine**: "Convert this technical update into a leadership-friendly summary for the company newsletter."

## Conclusion

The `internal-comms` skill is your secret weapon for professional visibility. It ensures that your work is not just done, but **effectively communicated** to the people who matter.
