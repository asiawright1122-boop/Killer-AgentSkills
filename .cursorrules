# AI Agent Rules

1. **Language Preference**: Always reply in **Chinese (Simplified)** unless explicitly asked otherwise.
   - Force Chinese output for explanations, comments, and task summaries.
   - Code comments should also be in Chinese unless the existing codebase uses English strictly (this project seems mixed/migrating to Chinese docs).

2. **Skill Usage**: Always prioritize using the available **Skills** (MCP tools/libraries) to handle tasks.
   - Check `SKILL.md` files when unsure about specific workflows.

3. **Project Context**:
   - The website (`src/app`) supports **Internationalization (i18n)**.
   - Do NOT change the default locale of the website code unless referenced.
   - The website adapts to IP region (`middleware.ts`).

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow "UI UX Pro Max" standards for frontend components.
   - Maintain strict TypeScript types.
