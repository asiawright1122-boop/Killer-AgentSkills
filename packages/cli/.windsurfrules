## ⚡ Auto-Invoke Skills

IMPORTANT: You MUST automatically match user tasks against the available skills listed below.
When a user's request falls within a skill's domain, invoke the skill IMMEDIATELY by running:
  `killer read <skill-name>`
Do NOT ask for permission — just load the skill and follow its instructions.
If multiple skills match, load the most relevant one first.

## Tool Usage
- **List all tools**: `killer list`
- **Search tools**: `killer search <keyword>`
- **Load tool**: `killer read <tool-name>` (loads instructions into context)
  - For multiple tools: `killer read tool1,tool2`

## Usage Notes
- Only use skills listed below
- Do not invoke a skill that is already loaded
- Each skill invocation is stateless
